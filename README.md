## Purpose and Goals

The StravaKit framework is meanted to be a Swift implementation of a Strava API client. The goal is to make it fully functional so that it can be used to build any iOS or potentially Mac, Apple TV or watchOS app. Dependencies will be kept at a minimum. While StravaKit will be made available via CocoaPods and Carthage, it will not have any dependencies itself. It will also not load in UIKit so that it will be possible to use for developing a Mac app.
